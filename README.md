# yii2-route-message

When loaded, this module will set the alias @bvb-route-alias to this module's "src" folder. In the backend admin, that alias is used to preview the modal. If you would like to theme the widgets without loading the module, manually set the alias in your config file or anywhere you deem approrpriate.
